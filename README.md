# ORHP_CRUD
This is an application that has an angular front end that renders a UI with List of users in the application and ability to add users as needed.
Courses can be added to a user from the List by entering the name of the course too. 

For running this application we need to run the angular app by using angular cli command ng serve 
For running the java backend we need to just use maven command, spring-boot:run
